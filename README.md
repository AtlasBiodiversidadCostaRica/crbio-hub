# generic-hub

Generic-hub is a [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) web application that is aimed to be an exmaple implementation of the 
ALA biocache (occurrence record search interface). There is very little code in this project as most of the functionality 
is provided by a Grails plugin called [biocache-hubs](http://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/biocache-hubs).

## Getting started
First download and install [Grails](http://www.grails.org/download) (check the `application.properties' file
to see which version is required). Fork this project to your local machine.

Then try running the app with the command line:

    cd generic-hub
    grails run-app
